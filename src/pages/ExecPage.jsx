        Hi there! I am Cris Canayon and I have the honour to be your ZOO
        president for this year. I am a third year software major who's been
        involved in ZOO since my first year. In the past, I have served as VP
        Internal for ZOO and Co-Team Lead in AC Robotic's Sumobots team. Outside
        of uni, I'm a massive foodie who likes to travel and work out. Feel free
        to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, or both!
